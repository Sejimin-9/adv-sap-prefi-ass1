## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
According to Amazon.com, Service Oriented Architecture is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. In my Opinion These can lessen the time spent in developing a system especially if the system will need services that can be used in every organizations. like for instance, you will develop a two system that will need a biometric scanner, this biometric scanner service will be used by both system. so that it can lessen the time spent on developing seperate system, knowing that it has the same function.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
I think the characteristics that i see is it should be INTUITIVE what im trying to say is it should be easily accessible for every user who desire to use it. It must follow the right ethics of a service so that everyone would be able to comprehend it, the standards of every services should be followed.
second is it should have a SEPERATIONS OF CONCERN, SOA should not be always dependent on the outside resources, like users. to avoid disruptions to the service used by others

3. Define Microservices.
According to microservice.io The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably a necessity for competing and winning in todayâ€™s world.
this imply that 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
The first thing i noticed about the characteristic of Microservices is, it's CALIBRATED, for instance i want to develop a appointment system, microservices will breakdown each part of the system need like for instance consumer service, appointment service this will come the booking, what im trying to say is the services it offered where precise since it is made only for the specific application

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
I assume that their similarity is the purpose of them, they are both services which imply that they offer variation of services according to everyone needs.

Moreover, one thing i notice about the difference about these 2 is SOA is about SERVICE INTEGRATION and Microservices is SPECIFIC, why did i say this since SOA is used widely by different users who have the same desired service. in able to lessen the work and lessen of their workload, microservices offers a spevific services for a specifi problem in your team or organization which is exclusive to all of you only inside the team.
